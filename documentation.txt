8. Current Issue Encountered
Chat history and FAQ responses stopped working after removing non-DHVSU users from the Google Sheet. The backend script relies on user data for logging and matching FAQs. If the user is missing, the script fails silently. A quick fix is to restore the user data in the Google Sheet and ensure the backend script correctly validates and logs user data. Note: The user cannot restore the removed users because the data was deleted yesterday. The user will need to manually re-add the users to the Google Sheet to restore functionality.

# Recent Progress and Enhancements (Latest Update)

## 1. Recent Enhancements and Changes (Since Yesterday)

### A. Email Domain Restriction
- Only official Pampanga State University emails ending with `@dhvsu.edu.ph` are allowed for signup, login, and profile updates.
- Both frontend and backend enforce this restriction, with clear error messages for invalid emails.

### B. User Identification Logic
- The system now uses **email** (not username) as the primary identifier for all user-related operations.
- This ensures uniqueness and consistency, especially with the new email domain restriction.

### C. Profile Editing Restriction
- Users can no longer change their email address from their profile page.
- This maintains the integrity of the email-based user identification and prevents circumvention of the domain restriction.

### D. Rebranding
- All references to "Don Honorio Ventura State University (DHVSU)" were updated to "Pampanga State University" in the UI and documentation, while temporarily retaining the DHVSU logo.

### E. Codebase Clean-up and Security
- Improved normalization and validation of user input for login and signup.
- Ensured all user actions (login, signup, FAQ queries) are logged in the appropriate Google Sheets.
- Added more robust error handling and logging in the backend.

---

## 2. Problems and Issues Encountered

### A. Backend Not Receiving Parameters
- **Symptom:** All POST requests to the backend result in `Received POST request: undefined` and `Invalid request: Missing parameters`.
- **Impact:** Signup, login, FAQ queries, and logging do not work.
- **Root Cause:** The Apps Script backend is not receiving the expected parameters from the frontend, likely due to an incorrect or outdated web app URL, deployment settings, or request formatting issues.

### B. Google Sheets Data Structure
- If the Users or FAQ sheets are missing required columns or have malformed data, all user-related actions fail.

### C. FAQ Matching and Logging Failures
- The bot always responds with "not in the database" even for known questions, due to backend or sheet structure issues.

---

## 3. Troubleshooting and Debugging Steps Taken

- Added extensive logging in the backend to capture incoming requests and parameter parsing.
- Verified frontend request code to ensure it uses `FormData` and does not set the `Content-Type` header manually.
- Checked Apps Script deployment to confirm it is set as a web app with "Anyone" access.
- Tested endpoint with Postman/curl to isolate whether the issue is with the frontend or backend.
- Reviewed Google Sheets structure to ensure all required columns are present and correctly named.

---

## 4. Current Action Items / Recommendations

1. Verify and update the Apps Script web app URL in all frontend files to match the latest deployment.
2. Ensure the Apps Script is deployed as a web app with "Anyone" access and "Execute as Me".
3. Check the structure of the Users and FAQ sheets in Google Sheets for required columns.
4. Test the backend endpoint directly (using Postman/curl) to confirm it receives parameters.
5. Monitor Apps Script logs for incoming requests and errors after each test.

  // 2. Multiple Matching Strategies
  let scoredFaqs = faqs.map(faq => {
    let score = 0;
    
    // Exact Match (100 points)
    if (faqQNorm === userQNorm) {
      score = 100;
    } else {
      // Jaccard Similarity (up to 80 points)
      const jaccard = calculateJaccardSimilarity(userQNorm, faqQNorm);
      score += jaccard * 80;
      
      // Keyword Overlap (10 points per match)
      if (faq.keywords) {
        const keywords = faq.keywords.toLowerCase().split(',');
        keywords.forEach(keyword => {
          if (userQNorm.includes(keyword)) score += 10;
        });
      }
      
      // Phrase Matching (20 points)
      if (faqQNorm.includes(userQNorm) || userQNorm.includes(faqQNorm)) {

### Advanced Category Detection
```javascript
// Enhanced category detection logic
let category = "general";

if (chat.category && typeof chat.category === 'string') {
  const rawCategory = chat.category.trim().toLowerCase();
  
  // First look for exact match in our mapping
  if (categoryMapping[rawCategory]) {
    category = rawCategory;
  } 
  // If no exact match, look for partial match
  else {
    for (const key in categoryMapping) {
      if (rawCategory.includes(key) || key.includes(rawCategory)) {
        category = key;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // If we still don't have a match, use the raw value
  if (category === "general" && rawCategory !== "general" && rawCategory.length > 0) {
    category = rawCategory;
  }
}

// If we detect ID-related question, use "Registrar" category
const questionLower = chat.question.toLowerCase();
if (category === "general" && 
    (questionLower.includes("id") || 
     questionLower.includes("card") || 
     questionLower.includes("registration") ||
     questionLower.includes("certificate"))) {
  category = "registrar";
}
```

### Timestamp Uniqueness Logic
```javascript
// Generate unique timestamp with milliseconds
const now = new Date();
const timestamp = now.toISOString();

// Keep track of used timestamps to ensure uniqueness
const usedTimestamps = new Set();

// Create uniqueness if timestamp already exists
if (usedTimestamps.has(formattedTimestamp)) {
  // Add some randomness to ensure uniqueness
  now.setMilliseconds(now.getMilliseconds() + Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000));
  formattedTimestamp = now.toISOString();
}
  
// Add this timestamp to the used set
usedTimestamps.add(formattedTimestamp);
```

// Ensure the category column exists
const convHeaders = conversationSheet.getRange(1, 1, 1, conversationSheet.getLastColumn()).getValues()[0];
const convCategoryCol = convHeaders.indexOf('category');
    
if (convCategoryCol === -1) {
  // If category column doesn't exist, add it
  conversationSheet.insertColumnAfter(convHeaders.length);
  conversationSheet.getRange(1, convHeaders.length + 1).setValue('category');
  
  // Update row to include category in the new column
