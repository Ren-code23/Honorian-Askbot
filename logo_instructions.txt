IMPORTANT: How to Add Your Custom AskBot Logo
==================================

The AskBot logo (askbot_logo.png) needs to be manually uploaded by you:

1. Prepare your logo image:
   - Create a square image (recommended 200x200 pixels)
   - Save it as PNG format with the filename "askbot_logo.png"
   - Make sure it has a transparent background for best results

2. Upload the file to your GitHub repository:
   - Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Ren-code23/Honorian-Askbot
   - Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop your askbot_logo.png file
   - Add a commit message like "Add custom AskBot logo"
   - Click "Commit changes"

3. Verify the file is uploaded:
   - Refresh your GitHub repository page
   - You should see the askbot_logo.png file in the file list
   
That's it! Your website should now use your custom AskBot logo instead of the default university logo.

Note: If you're still seeing the university logo, try clearing your browser cache:
- Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) while on your website
- Or try opening the site in an incognito/private browsing window
